# Hey all :wave:

This is a placeholder organization for some projects I've been working on for the last couple of months.

## [Noodles UI](https://github.com/noodlestan/noodles-ui)

> A design system code generator.

Generates components, their styles, strongly typed variants, and theme files, including CSS tokens and TS tokens.

Quickly add styles to a catalogue of high quality headless components and primitives ([Kobalte](https://kobalte.dev), and Noodles own catalogue).

Still early days, but already useful for my own projects.

- Comfortable CLI and live-preview experience
- Currently capable of generating SolidJS components with SCSS modules styles.
- Could potentially target React, Vue, Svelte or native libraries, as well as Tailwind, PandaCSS, Vanilla, and other styling stacks.

## [Mr. Noodles](https://github.com/noodlestan/mr-noodles)

> A bespoke media center

I mostly use it to browse my collection of photos and videos when at home.

- saves money (no expensive photo cloud account)
- images and videos load blazing fast on phones, tablets, and the living room projector
- we know where the pictures are (meaning old school folders)
- we can organize them however we want
- the whole family (and visitors) can browse and share media
