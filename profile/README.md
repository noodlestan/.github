### [Mr. Noodles](https://github.com/noodlestan/mr-noodles)

> A bespoke family/houseld _#nocloud_ media server

We built a prototype a few months ago that we use it to browse collections of photos and videos at home. No more paying for cloud storage or waiting for 🐌🐌 slow UI when we want to find *that* video from 1999. And by moving the photos directly from the device to the household storage we (try to) make sure that no AI is being trained with our cat photos.
