# Noodlestan Collective 🐘

> UX. Design. Code. Web. 3D. Audio. The works.

## 👐 Welcome to Noodlestan!

We are an open collective of people dedicated to the design and software crafts.

We are designing and writing software because we are in love with the possibilities, and because we thrive to collaborate and create things together.

We have been chasing a few wild dreams, and and can't wait to show you where it's leading us. We are also proud, but scared, yet excited... well, it's complicated.

## 👋 Get in touch

We are glad to meet you and look forward to hearing what YOU think.
